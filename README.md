**Data Sources**  
The dataset includes images classified into two categories: 'Car' and 'Not Car.' It was sourced from publicly available repositories on Kaggle, including:  
- [Cars Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kshitij192/cars-image-dataset)  
- [Universal Image Embeddings Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhtsingh/130k-images-512x512-universal-image-embeddings)

**Methodology**  
- **Model Architecture**: The ResNet-50 model was fine-tuned for binary classification by modifying its output layer to a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function.  
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling were implemented to increase dataset diversity.  
- **Training Strategy**: The model was trained using the Adam optimizer, with a learning rate scheduler, early stopping, and model checkpointing to optimize the process.  

**Evaluation Metrics**  
Performance was assessed using:  
- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix
